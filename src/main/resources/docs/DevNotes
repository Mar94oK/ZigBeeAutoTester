1) Check what is it
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: You have loaded library /tmp/jSerialComm/2.9.3/libjSerialComm.so which might have disabled stack guard. The VM will try to fix the stack guard now.
It's highly recommended that you fix the library with 'execstack -c <libfile>', or link it with '-z noexecstack'.

And try to fix like written here
